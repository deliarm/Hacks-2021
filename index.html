      <p align="left" id="explanation">
            As students, stress is not a foreign concept. It's familiar now more than ever due to the ongoing Covid 19
            pandemic, the stress of students has increased dramatically.
            Many of us spend the majority of our time alone in our rooms, doing our school work or trying
            to relax. Some of us do not even get the chance to communicate with friends,
            or family. As students, we often wonder how to survive in an online environment,
            and why we feel the things we do. Through this assessment, you will learn more about yourself,
            and hopefully find some solutions to the problems faced in the ongoing pandemic.

          <br>
          <br>  
            The asssesment is broken down into 4 sub categories that each evaluate their own associated attributes
            and qualities. At the end of the exam you will be given a report that states areas of concern, you will also
            be provided with several resources based on your specific needs. The categories of the assesment are further
            described below.
            
            <br>
            <br>

            <h3 align="left"> Mental Stress </h2>
              <p align="left">
                  Mental Stress is the extent to which we feel overwhelmed. The feeling of being overwhelmed often results in a loss of the ability to cope, as a result of
                  too much pressure. Students may feel overwhelmed when given too many assignments or tests, this can result in 
                  misdirected anger,mood, and behaviour changes that are not desired.
                </p>


            <h3 align="left"> Relationships </h2>
                <p align="left">
                    Relationships refer to close connections between people, formed by emotional bonds and interactions. Overtime
                    these bonds are strengthened by mutual experiences. During the development of these relationships we learn 
                    interpersonal skills such as speaking and effective listening, these are very valuable skills that carry forward
                    for the rest of our lives. Failure to develop relationships with others may lead to consequences down the line such
                    as anxiety, fear of public speaking and an inability to form bonds with others.
                </p>


            <h3 align="left"> Productivity </h2>
                <p align="left">
                    Productivity is commonly defined as the ratio between the output volume and the volume of input.
                    An individuals productivity hinges on mental energy and a sense of motivation. High productivity can
                    be the result of a mix of factors including personality,talent,environment and support from others.
                    A lack of productivity could indicate that one or more of the named fields are not being satisfied.
                      
                </p>


            <h3 align="left"> Physical Wellness </h2>
                <p align="left">
                    The physical wellness of somebody is reflective of how they take care of their own body. Things like sleeping well, getting enough physical activity, and eating healthy
                    are important in keeping ones physical wellness up. Due to Covid 19, and the nature of working from home, the general physical wellness of students has seen a decline.
                    To help people struggling with this, we have created a couple of links and suggestions for post-assesment.
